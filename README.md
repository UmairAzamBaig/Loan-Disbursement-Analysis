## Loan-Disbursement-Analysis

This project focuses on analyzing loan disbursements using Power BI, applying Power Query and DAX to calculate monthly disbursements in EUR for the last 6 months.

## Analysis Components

# Disbursement per Loan Officer

Analyzing disbursement amounts per loan officer to understand individual performance and distribution.

# Portfolio at Risk

Evaluating the portfolio at risk to identify potential credit risks and manage them effectively.

# Data Structure

The project comprises two tables: dimension and fact.
The loan table is considered as the fact table, containing multiple entries for loans.
The loan detail table is treated as the dimension table due to its fewer entries and containing master data.

# Loan Disbursement Analysis

The analysis delves into the loan disbursements of the past six months, filtering by branch, product, and loan officer.
Visualization of the loan disbursement for the last month provides a snapshot of recent activity.

# Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

Visualizing KPIs such as the portfolio at risk helps in monitoring and managing loan portfolios effectively.

# Invalid Loan List
A list of invalid loans is provided, indicating loans with missing master data for further investigation and rectification.
